# SQL-code
This repository includes SQL code I wrote when I learnt SQL from class at school. 

In file SubqueriesAndJoinTable, I used two different methods - join and subqueries - to select required results from database.

In file Self-join, I used self-join instead of subqueries to select required results from database. Some of queries are complicated.

In file Subqueries, I used subqueries in different parts of queries such as Having clause, Where cluase and practiced using independent subquery.

After writing these code, I have a good command of subqueries and self-join in SQL now.
